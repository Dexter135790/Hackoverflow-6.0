## CropPred: Predicting the crop yeild

## Project for Hackerflow 6.0

## Overview

The objective of this project is to predict the crop yield of different crops based on various environmental factors using multiple linear regression. The project aims to assist farmers in maximizing their crop yield by identifying the most important factors that influence crop yield.

## Running the program

Open the application.js in project folder. Run the file. And go to the port number 3000 for localhost.

## Data Collection and Preparation

The dataset used for this project was our default but the users can upload their dataset to train the model on so that it is flexible. The dataset includes information on the yield of crops depending on various environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, and soil quality. The data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed on the dataset to understand the distribution and correlation of the variables. The analysis revealed that there were strong correlations between crop yield and environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, and soil quality.


## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering techniques were used to transform the data into a format suitable for machine learning models. The dataset was split into training and testing sets.

## Model Development

Multiple linear regression was used to build the machine learning models. The models were trained using the training set and hyperparameters were tuned using cross-validation techniques. The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

## Model Evaluation

The evaluation of the models showed that they were able to predict crop yield with a high degree of accuracy. The models were able to identify the most important factors that influence crop yield, such as temperature and soil quality.

## Results and Conclusions

The results of this project demonstrate that multiple linear regression is an effective technique for predicting crop yield based on environmental factors. The project provides farmers with a tool for optimizing their crop yield and improving their farming practices.

## Future Work

There are several areas for future work in this project, including the exploration of other machine learning techniques such as decision trees and random forests. In addition, further analysis could be performed to identify the specific environmental factors that have the greatest impact on crop yield.
